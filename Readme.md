# Hello There!

This is nothing but a **CLI** **application** made with **nodejs**. 

Story Behind The Project:
My Senior Engineer asked me if I can check a number if it's palindrom , but without

> converting or comparing them as string.

So I made this.
The actuall code base is very small, but something sparked in my mind, that why not make it beautiful and at a position where people can accept it as a Basic App to start Coding with node.js!

I love node js, And if you love, then please dont hesitate to give a star So I can make some small but fun apps for new learners.
